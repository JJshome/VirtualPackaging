## üåü Overview

VirtualPackaging revolutionizes the traditional packaging design process by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies. The system automates the entire workflow from 3D product scanning to factory-ready packaging designs, dramatically reducing time and costs while optimizing for both product protection and environmental considerations.

The conventional packaging design process typically involves numerous variables, requires significant time and expense, and demands specialized expertise. VirtualPackaging transforms this workflow with a simple, intuitive approach:

1. **Capture** product images using a smartphone
2. **Generate** 3D reconstructions of your products
3. **Design** optimal packaging with AI assistance
4. **Customize** through interactive LLM conversations
5. **Export** factory-ready CAD files for immediate production
